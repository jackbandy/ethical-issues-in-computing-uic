# Select a Book to Read!

Based on a survey from Fall 2025, almost half of the students (45%) in 377 had yet to read a book in the first eight months of the year.

If all goes well, everyone in this class will have read a book by the end of the semester.

But nobody is going to tell you what to read -- **you must choose which book to read.**

The requirements are pretty loose:
* The book must be related to technology and society
* It must be a book you have not read before
* It must be at least ~100 pages
* There are no formal criteria for genre or language

## What to turn in for this part
To receive full credit answer the following six questions in the Canvas text box:
1. Which book did you choose?
2. Who wrote the book?
3. How long is the book?
4. How did you learn about the book?
5. What is one thing you want to learn from reading this book?
6. Give two additional reasons why this book seems interesting to you.


## Some Book Options (Work-in-progress)
Choose something you are genuinely curious about! As mentioned in class, this is an opportunity to go in-depth on a topic you want to learn more about.
