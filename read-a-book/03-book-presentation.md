# Book Presentation

You chose a book, and you chose a book you wanted to read! As we approach the end of the semester, it's time to share what you've learned with the class.

This will take the form of a ~10-minute presentation, with the schedule to be announced later in the semester.

Here are some guidelines for "one way to make a successful presentation," adapted from [Colorado State University](https://writing.colostate.edu/guides/teaching/e238/paex.cfm).
* **Talk to us, don't read**. You may use notes when you make your presentation, but you may not read from a fully written out text.
* **Do plenty of reading and research**, not just from your book, but also the broader context of the book. Take notes!
* **Discuss your presentation topic with others** as you plan the presentation in its general outlines.
* **Brainstorm** and write down all the interesting ideas that have come from the book.
  * Try to write down as many as possible so you can choose the most interesting ones
* **Organize** your ideas into a coherent sequence that tells a story
  * This should be *your* story, not the exact same story as the book!
* Add an introduction, which tells what you will talk about, and a conclusion which sums up what you have discussed and learned.
* Meet with classmates, TAs, and/or the instructor to organize and **polish the presentation**.
* Visualize yourself giving a talk to the class, going through all these ideas, in a comfortable and relaxed fashion.
  * It can be helpful to practice giving the presentation to friend and/or in a mirror.

If you follow the guidlines above, you'll be in great shape to give your presentation to the class.

## Frequently Asked Questions
* **Question**: What exactly should the presentation be about?
  * **Answer**: Teach us something from the book you read, or something closely related to the book!
* **Question**: Can you give an example?
  * **Answer**: You can view a [demo presentation here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tggnphB6tbu_nj1kYEVYBRgTsNI2nVbTjdjleAReTyc/edit?usp=sharing)
* **Question**: How many slides should I have?
  * **Answer**: Using the heuristic of 1 minute per slide, a 10-minute presentation will probably have about 10 slides. 
* **Question**: Where should I put my slides?
  * **Answer**: To minimize technical hiccups, please make your presentation in Google Slides and place them [in this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Uqdj2rv5DhZZha7jmTWdCdtA7mJcXL-l?usp=share_link)

## Rubric
I will be using a rubric derived from two sources: [this analytic rubric](https://uofi.box.com/s/ojkbtoa3g5rmvgvr4tfm8mmid2gqq4st) for a presentation from UIC's Center for the Advancement of Teaching Excellence, and [this rubric for CS 440 presentations](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~i440/CS_440_Presentation_Evaluation_Rubric.pdf).
