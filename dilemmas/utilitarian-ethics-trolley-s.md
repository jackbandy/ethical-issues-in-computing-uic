# The Trolley Problem (S Version)

There is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people. The trolley is headed straight for them.

You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. Unfortunately, you notice that there is one person on the side track.

You have two options:  
(1) Do nothing, and the trolley kills the five people on the main track.  
(2) Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.

What should be done?
