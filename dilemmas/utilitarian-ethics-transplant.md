# The Transplant Case

A brilliant transplant surgeon has five patients, each in need of a different organ, each of whom will die without that organ. Unfortunately, there are no organs available to perform any of these five transplant operations.

A healthy young traveler, just passing through the city, comes in for a routine checkup. In the course of doing the checkup, the surgeon discovers that the traveler's organs are immunologically compatible with all five dying patients.

Suppose further that if the young traveler were to disappear, nobody would suspect the surgeon or the hospital, and there would be no legal or practical complications.

Would it be permissible for the surgeon to kill the healthy traveler and distribute the organs to save the five patients?
