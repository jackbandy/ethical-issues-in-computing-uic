# The Heinz Dilemma

A lady was dying because she was very sick. There was one drug the doctors said might save her. This medicine was discovered by a man living in that same town. It cost him $400 to make it, but he charged $4000 for just a little bit of it. The sick lady's husband, Heinz, tried to borrow enough money to buy the drug. He went to everyone he knew to borrow the money. But he could only borrow half of what he needed. He told the man who made the drug that his wife was dying, and asked him to sell the medicine cheaper or let him pay him later. But the man said "No, I made the drug and I am going to make money from it." So Heinz broke into the store and stole the drug.

Should Heinz have stolen the drug? Why or why not?
