# The Trolley Problem (F Version)

There is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people. The trolley is headed straight for them.
You are on a bridge, watching the events from above the tracks. There is a man next to you. You realize that, if you push him off the footbridge and down onto the tracks below, the trolley will hit and kill him, but his body will stop the trolley before it reaches the five endangered people.

You have two options:
(1) Do nothing, and the trolley kills the five people.
(2) Push the man off the bridge, so that he dies, but the five others are saved.

What should be done?
