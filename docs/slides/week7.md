- **Classification** — what kind of face is shown in the image?
- **Identification** — whose face is shown in the image?
:::

## Small Group Discussion

- Where have you seen facial recognition used?
- Which task(s) do you think it was performing, and why?
  - Is there a face in the image? (detection)
  - What are the attributes of the face shown? (classification)
  - Whose face is shown? (identification)
- What could go wrong?

---

## Where Have You Seen Facial Recognition?

Examples from a 2020 Algorithmic Justice League report:

- **Banks** — transaction security
- **Events** — concert ticket verification
- **Housing** — ring doorbells
- **Police** — searching mugshot databases
- **Schools** — attendance tracking
- **Stores** — payments, market research
- **Workplaces** — interviews

# Gender Shades {.title-slide .section-header}

---

## Gender Shades

- Joy Buolamwini's master's project at the MIT Media Lab
- The project began when a Halloween party mask was detected as a face, but her own face was not
- 2023 book: *Unmasking AI*

# Evaluating Systems {.title-slide .section-header}

---

## Evaluating Systems

::: {.incremental}
- **"How well does this work overall?"**
  - Singular metric of success
  - Often hides subtleties

- **"How well does this work for different groups of people?"**
  - Reveals disparities
  - Shows "compound disadvantages"
:::

---

## Connecting Some Dots (Again)

How do the four ethical frameworks apply to facial recognition?

:::: columns
::: {.column width="48%"}
- **Virtue ethics**: What character traits do responsible facial-recognition engineers cultivate?
- **Deontological**: Do we have a right not to be identified? Does BIPA reflect a duty-based framework?
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
- **Utilitarian**: What aggregate harms vs. benefits? Whose well-being is measured?
- **Care ethics**: Who bears the burden of error? Who is most vulnerable?
:::
::::

---

## iClicker Check-in

"Facial recognition should be approached as a technical task, independent from social context."

- Strong disagree / Disagree / Not sure / Agree / Strong agree

---

## Debrief

- What did you learn?
- What stuck out to you?
- What questions do you still have?

---

## Preview: "Codename Delphi"

- Written by Linda Nagata
- Read before next class
- Discussion questions will be posted to Canvas

---

## That's all for today! See you Wednesday!

- How are you taking notes / keeping track of what you're learning?
- What does your "reading schedule" look like for the next few weeks?

---

## Speculative Fiction Exercise Overview

- We've read three stories — now it's your turn to write your own!
- In brief: write more than one page; have fun with it
- See Canvas for the current deadline
- We will vote on the best stories in class next week

# War and Computing in the News {.title-slide .section-header}

---

## War and Computing in Recent News

<!-- image: recent news headlines on AI and military (e.g. Anthropic/Pentagon, OpenAI Pentagon deal) -->
- TODO: add image — *recent news headlines on AI and military (e.g. Anthropic/Pentagon, OpenAI Pentagon deal)*

---

## In (Very) Recent News

- Pentagon banned Anthropic on February 27, designating it a "supply-chain risk"
- OpenAI announced a Pentagon deal hours later
- February 28 – March 1: U.S.–Israel strikes on Iran
- Reports: Anthropic services were used in the attacks

---

## Anthropic's "Red Lines"

:::: columns
::: {.column width="48%"}
**Mass domestic surveillance**

"Using these systems for mass domestic surveillance is incompatible with democratic values. AI-driven mass surveillance presents serious, novel risks to our fundamental liberties."
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
**Fully autonomous weapons**

"Frontier AI systems are simply not reliable enough to power fully autonomous weapons. We will not knowingly provide a product that puts America's warfighters and civilians at risk."

# Computing and War Before LLMs {.title-slide .section-header}

---

## Computing and War: Before LLMs

*(This was supposed to be the "stories" unit…)*

---

## ARPANET

- U.S. DoD Advanced Research Projects Agency Network
- Originally linked Pentagon-funded research computers
- Needed robust / redundant communication tools during the Cold War
- ARPANET went live in 1969
- TCP/IP protocol launched in the 1970s, standardized in 1983
- Civilian / academic networks evolved to become the Internet

---

## Alan Turing and World War II

- During WW2 (1939–1945), Turing worked at Bletchley Park to break German military ciphers
- Automated search over Enigma keys, led to large-scale computational machinery ("Colossus")
- Historians estimate this shortened the war by 2 years

---

## Project Maven (2018)

- Google provided image classification services to label objects from military drone videos
- Thousands of Google employees signed petitions; some resigned
- Google chose not to renew Project Maven; added AI ethics principles
- Changes were largely a result of sustained worker pressure

---

## Stuxnet (2009)

- Computer worm used to sabotage Iran's nuclear program
- Targeted Siemens industrial control systems (ICS) at Natanz
- Caused centrifuges to spin irregularly but report normal readings to operators
- *Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First Digital Weapon* (Kim Zetter)

# "Not Without Us" {.title-slide .section-header}

---

## Not Without Us {.quote-slide}

> "None of the weapon systems which today threaten murder on a genocidal scale,
> and whose design, manufacture and sale condemns countless people, especially
> children, to poverty and starvation, that none of these devices could be developed
> without the earnest, even enthusiastic, cooperation of computer professionals.
> It cannot go on without us!"
>
> — Joseph Weizenbaum, "Not Without Us" (1986)

---

## "Not Without Us": Key Arguments

- 1986 speech by MIT computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum
- Argued that computing professionals must actively resist uses of computing that dehumanize
- Warned about dissolved responsibility for harmful outcomes
- "The machine said…" — humans must own moral decisions

---

# "Codename Delphi" {.title-slide .section-header}

---

## Switching to Fiction!

---

## "Codename Delphi" (2014)

- Written by Linda Nagata

---

## Table Discussion: "Codename Delphi"

- Imagine you had to do Karin's job for a week. What challenges do you imagine might come up?
- Why does Karin find it unacceptable that some fellow handlers describe the job as being like a video game?
- What virtues and habits has Karin cultivated in order to excel as a handler?
- What else did the story make you think about?

---

## Ethical Frameworks Applied

- **Virtue ethics**: What virtues does Karin demonstrate? Which vices does she resist?
- **Deontological**: Are there moral absolutes in warfare? (Weizenbaum says yes)
- **Care ethics**: Who bears the relational costs of automated warfare?
- **Utilitarian**: How do we weigh military effectiveness against human costs?

---

## Preview: "If an Algorithm Can Cast a Shadow"

- Written by Claire Jia-Wen
- 34-minute audio version available (link in Canvas)
- Read before Wednesday's class
- Complete the Canvas discussion by Tuesday at 11:59pm

---

## That's all for today!

See you next week!
