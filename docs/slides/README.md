# Slides

The slide sources use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) Reveal.js.

GitHub Actions renders the slide HTML for commits to `main` using
`.github/workflows/build-slides.yml`. The decks are configured with
`embed-resources: true`, so the generated `.html` files are self-contained and
can be committed without the bulky `*_files/` support directories.

Run `./build.sh` locally when you want to preview changes before pushing or
when you want to generate PDFs on-device. The local build requires Quarto,
Node.js 22+, Python with PyMuPDF, and Chrome or Chromium. Set `CHROME` to a
browser executable if it is not found automatically, or set
`BUILD_PDFS=false` for HTML-only local builds.

HTML output is CI-managed. PDFs are generated locally and ignored by default.

## Deck structure

`_metadata.yml` sets `slide-level: 2`, so the two heading levels do different
jobs:

- `#` opens a section: the day title slides (`{.title-slide}` and
  `{.title-slide .photo-title}`), the topic dividers
  (`# Topic {.title-slide .section-header}`), and the closing sources slide.
- `##` is an ordinary slide, grouped under the section above it.

Sections show up as a vertical stack per topic and as the grouping in the
navigation menu (press `M` while presenting). Navigation stays linear, so the
arrow keys still walk the deck in order.

## The slides index

`index.html` lists every deck, the class days inside it, and the
`{.section-header}` topics under each day. Everything between the
`sync_slide_index.py` markers in that file is generated — edit the decks, not
the index. `build.sh` regenerates it after rendering, and the script can be run
on its own:

```
python3 sync_slide_index.py
```

Days come from each deck's `CS 377, Week N, Day M 🟦 Station 🟦` subtitle line.
Meetings the decks say nothing about still get a stop, from
`_data/schedule.csv`: a cancelled class shows the reason from
`_includes/schedule-topics.md`, and a class whose slides are not written yet is
marked "slides to come". The summary table's Topic column is that CSV's `Topic`
field, one short phrase per class day.

A section header can stay out of the index with `{.section-header .no-index}`.

`week0.md` is the starter deck. Copy it when beginning a new week and update
the title, footer, URL, and content.

The build script also accepts `.qmd` decks, but this repository uses `.md` for
slide sources.
