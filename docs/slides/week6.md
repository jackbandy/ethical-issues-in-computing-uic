# De-Anonymization {.title-slide .section-header}

---

## Privacy in Data

Two tales of privacy:

- **Tale 1:** Census data (1997)
- **Tale 2:** The Netflix Prize (2007)

---

## Latanya Sweeney

- Faculty at Harvard; PhD from MIT (2001)
- Public Interest Tech Lab; Data Privacy Lab
- Known for:
  - K-anonymity
  - De-anonymization research
  - Algorithmic bias research

---

## De-Anonymization: Census Data (1997) {.quote-slide}

> "For twenty dollars I purchased the voter registration list for
> Cambridge Massachusetts and received the information on two diskettes."
>
> — Latanya Sweeney (2000)

---

## De-Anonymization: Hospital Data {.quote-slide}

> "Most states (44 of 50 or 88%) collect hospital discharge data.
> Many of these states have subsequently distributed copies of these
> data to researchers, sold copies to industry and made versions
> publicly available."
>
> — Latanya Sweeney (2000)

---

## The Re-Identification Problem {.quote-slide}

> "The greater the number and detail of attributes reported about an entity,
> the more likely that those attributes combine uniquely to identify the entity."
>
> — Latanya Sweeney (2000)

---

## Why Attributes Combine Uniquely

"Given a random sample of 500 people, there are at least ⌈500 / 365⌉ = 2 people with the same birthday, because there are only 365 possible birthdays."

Each additional attribute (birthday, ZIP code, gender…) narrows the field much faster than intuition suggests.

---

## De-Anonymization Demo

Try it yourself: [aboutmyinfo.org/identity](https://aboutmyinfo.org/identity)

---

# K-Anonymity {.title-slide .section-header}

---

## K-Anonymity Demo

**Full dataset:**

| Name | Age | Team | Stop |
|---|---|---|---|
| Alice | 24 | Team Jeremiah | Grand |
| Bob | 28 | Team Conrad | Chicago |
| Carol | 27 | Team Conrad | Division |
| Dave | 24 | Team Jeremiah | Damen |
| Erin | 29 | Team Conrad | Western |

---

## K-Anonymity Demo: Names Suppressed

| Name | Age | Team | Stop |
|---|---|---|---|
| * | 24 | Team Jeremiah | Grand |
| * | 28 | Team Conrad | Chicago |
| * | 27 | Team Conrad | Division |
| * | 24 | Team Jeremiah | Damen |
| * | 29 | Team Conrad | Western |

---

## K-Anonymity Demo: Ages Generalized

| Name | Age | Team | Stop |
|---|---|---|---|
| * | 20 < Age ≤ 30 | Team Jeremiah | Grand |
| * | 20 < Age ≤ 30 | Team Conrad | Chicago |
| * | 20 < Age ≤ 30 | Team Conrad | Division |
| * | 20 < Age ≤ 30 | Team Jeremiah | Damen |
| * | 20 < Age ≤ 30 | Team Conrad | Western |

---

## K-Anonymity Demo: Stops Suppressed

| Name | Age | Team | Stop |
|---|---|---|---|
| * | 20 < Age ≤ 30 | Team Jeremiah | * |
| * | 20 < Age ≤ 30 | Team Conrad | * |
| * | 20 < Age ≤ 30 | Team Conrad | * |
| * | 20 < Age ≤ 30 | Team Jeremiah | * |
| * | 20 < Age ≤ 30 | Team Conrad | * |

This data has **2-anonymity** with respect to Age, Team: for any combination of these attributes found in any row, there are always at least 2 rows with those exact attributes.

---

## K-Anonymity Limitations

- Limited to one dataset (can still be linked to other records)
- All values are potentially identifying with "auxiliary" data
- Inferences just from knowing someone is in the dataset
  - e.g. "He has cancer, a heart disease, or viral infection"
- More formal attacks with background knowledge

---

# The Netflix Prize {.title-slide .section-header}

---

## Arvind Narayanan

- Directs "Center for Information Technology Policy" (Princeton)
- Degrees from Indian Institute of Technology Madras (2004)
- PhD from UT-Austin (2009)
- Significant contributions: algorithmic fairness, de-anonymization, cryptography

---

## Netflix Prize De-Anonymization

Netflix released a dataset of ~500,000 users and 100 million ratings (with names replaced by user IDs) for a $1M prize competition.

<!-- image: Netflix prize dataset sample with movie ratings and dates -->
- TODO: add image — *Netflix prize dataset sample with movie ratings and dates*

---

## iClicker Poll: "This Dataset Is Anonymized"

- Strong disagree / Disagree / Not sure / Agree / Strong agree

---

## Was the Netflix Dataset Anonymous? {.quote-slide}

Ratings for popular movies are less informative (e.g. top 10 most-rated: *Dark Knight, Fight Club, Godfather, Forrest Gump, The Matrix*…)

Ratings for **obscure** movies can de-identify:

- Movie-watching sequences become increasingly unique
- With only 8 movie ratings (even 2 possibly wrong) and dates (up to 2 weeks off), you can uniquely identify 99% of records

---

## Linking Netflix Data to IMDb

| Source | Record | Title | Date |
|---|---|---|---|
| Netflix data | User 172373 | The Dark Knight | December 30, 2004 |
| Netflix data | User 516182 | Jurassic Park | May 14, 2009 |
| IMDb data | (public review) | Jurassic Park | May 14, 2009 |

Public reviews carry names. Matching a handful of titles and dates re-attaches them.

---

## Takeaways: Anonymous Datasets

- Anonymous datasets still have risks
- Can be combined with already-identified data (e.g. IMDb)
- Apply contextual integrity: subject, sender, recipient, type, transmission principle?

---

# Why Short Stories? {.title-slide .section-header}

---

## Mini-lecture: Why Short Stories?

---

## Why Short Stories?

::: {.incremental}
- **Defamiliarization** — detach from preconceptions, expose your assumptions
- **Address recognizable human situations and problems** — explore them in terms of unfamiliar settings or technology
- **Normative + descriptive analysis** — both "is it right?" and "who is affected?"
- **It can be fun!**
:::

*Burton, Goldsmith, & Mattei (2018). "How to teach computer ethics through science fiction." CACM.*

---

## Some Examples of Sci-Fi Ethics Cases

<!-- image: examples of sci-fi/ethics short stories and novels used in ethics courses -->
- TODO: add image — *examples of sci-fi/ethics short stories and novels used in ethics courses*

---

## Recall: Normative and Descriptive Ethics

Stories give us both at once — the **normative** question ("was that right?") and the **descriptive** one ("who was involved, what were the stakes, what led here?").

---

## No Class Meetings Next Week!

Dr. Bandy is away — both classes next week are asynchronous.

Three things due soon — see Canvas for details!

---

## That's all for today!

See you Wednesday!

# "Message in a Bottle" {.title-slide .section-header}

---

## Discuss: "Message in a Bottle"

---

## Story Overview: "Message in a Bottle"

- Written by Nalo Hopkinson
- Central character is Greg
- Addresses challenges of utilitarian ethics
- Set in an unusual temporal context

---

## Table Discussion: "Message in a Bottle"

- What happened in this story? What was "the twist"?
- Describe what Greg values throughout the story. How does he decide?
- Children and adults are characterized as having different importance or significance — what differences did you notice?
- What seems to inform Kamla's judgments?

---

# Inequality, Justice, and Art {.title-slide .section-header}

---

## Mini-lecture: Inequality, Justice, and Art

---

## "The Excavations"

- Greg's exhibit, inspired by Russ's "anthill escapade"
- "Historical artifacts that the researchers tossed aside in their zeal to get at the iconic past…"
  - A rubber boot, a plastic jug
- "Don't you think the living are more important?"

---

## "The Excavations" and Utilitarianism

The "natural gallery" grant touches on key questions from utilitarianism:

- **Whose well-being?** All species: mollusc, sea cucumber, etc.
- **What is being used to define good/happiness/utility?**
- **When is the measure of success taken?** Right now — but looking into the future

---

## Art and Change {.quote-slide}

> Art helps us know how to do change.
>
> — Kamla, "Message in a Bottle"

---

# Digital Inequality {.title-slide .section-header}

---

## Mini-lecture: Digital Inequality

---

## The "Digital Divide" {.quote-slide}

> "The Internet is one in a long series of information and communications
> technologies — from speech, to printing, movable type, telegraphy,
> telephony, radio, and television — that arguably influenced patterns of
> social inequality by destroying existing competencies and permitting
> early adopters to interact with more people and acquire more information
> over greater distances and in a shorter time."
>
> — *From Unequal Access to Differentiated Use: A Literature Review*

---

## Who Uses the Internet More?

Research from the 1990s and 2000s showed differences along:

::: {.incremental}
- **Region** — "Rates of Internet use are highest in the northeast and far west"
- **Income** — "Internet use rates rise linearly with family income"
- **Education**
- **Age**
:::

---

## From "Digital Divide" to "Digital Inequality"

Key questions that reshaped the research:

::: {.incremental}
- What is "access"? (Device? Broadband? Skills?)
- Which "digital divide"? (there are many)
- How do we measure differences?
- Which inequalities will persist?
- What are people actually *able to do* when online?

## Folded Map Project

- Initiative by Tonika Lewis Johnson (Chicago)
- Goal: connect residents on the same street with "mirror" addresses
- Reveals how a single street address means radically different things across the city

<!-- image: Folded Map visualization -->
- TODO: add image — *Folded Map visualization*

---

## Table Activity: Folded Map

- Go to [foldedmapproject.com](https://foldedmapproject.com) → "Interactive Maps" (top right)
- Choose Social, Business, or Schools layer
- Explore and discuss
  - Where are you from? Where do you live? Where do you visit?
  - Try to find mirror addresses

---

## What Is This Map?

**Blockbusting** — targeting areas to make wealthy families sell ("the minorities are moving here!")

<!-- image: blockbusting map of Chicago -->
- TODO: add image — *blockbusting map of Chicago*

## Implications

Ads and algorithmic systems can reinforce inequality by influencing:

- Education
- Healthcare
- Housing
- Jobs

Ads range in how helpful or exploitative they can be.

::: {.fragment}
Example ad: "Miracle cure for focus. Ace your midterms."
