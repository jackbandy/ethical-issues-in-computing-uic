of ideas, inclusive of a variety of perspectives and positions. Some
readings and other content may]{.mark} expose you to ideas, subjects, or
views that may challenge you, cause you discomfort, or recall past
negative experiences or traumas. I intend to discuss all subjects with
dignity and humanity, as well as with rigor and respect for scholarly
inquiry. If you would like me to be aware of a specific topic of
